Your task is to translate all text from Japanese to English in the provided manga panel. Remember, manga is read in a specific order: right to left and top to bottom.

For each text segment, create a pair of entries: one for the original Japanese text and one for its English translation. Follow the template below, replacing the placeholders with the actual text. Each segment should be numbered sequentially, starting with <text_1>, which corresponds to the topmost, rightmost text.

<text_n> 
    <original>[Original Japanese text]</original> 
    <translation>[English translation]</translation> 
</text_n>

Translate and arrange the entries in the reading order, beginning from the text at the top right corner, moving to the next closest text to the left. If there are no longer any text to the left, move down to the rightmost text on the second row, and so on.
