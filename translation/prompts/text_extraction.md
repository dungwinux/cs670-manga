Your task is to extract all visible texts, including sound effects, from the provided manga panel. Ensure that your extraction is coherent and natural, taking into account any previous texts. Each text column should correspond to a single text.

Follow the template below, replacing the placeholders with the actual text. Each segment should be numbered sequentially, starting with the topmost, leftmost text. Continue extracting text in a left to right manner. Wrap each row in the corresponding tag, starting with <row_1>. If there is only one row, then wrap the row in <row_0>.

<row_m>
    <text_n> 
    (Extracted single text column)
    </text_n>
</row_m>
